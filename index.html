      <p>Founded in 1905, the club competes in the Premier League, the top division of English football.</p>

        <h3>Colours</h3>
        <p>Chelsea have always worn blue shirts, although they originally used the paler eton blue, which was taken from the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark blue or black socks.[105] The light blue shirts were replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912.[106] In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964â€“65 season.[107] Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when blue socks were reintroduced.</p>
